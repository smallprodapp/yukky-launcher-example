# Yukky Launcher Example
An exemple of how to make a custom launcher

In this repository, you will find an example of custom launcher. 

This example is the code used for the default launcher with default customization.

It will not work if you start like that because there's no CSS files and the Html file contains some Twig tags ({{ }}) but it shows you how you should do to make your own.
